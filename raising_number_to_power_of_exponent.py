# Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.

# pseudocode

# define a function called exponent that takes in two parameters, base and exp

# return base raised to the power of exp

# ask user for input for base and exp
base = int(input("Enter the base: "))
exp = int(input("Enter the exponent: "))

# print the result of the function call
result = exponent(base, exp)
print(base, "raised to the power of", exp, "is", result)
